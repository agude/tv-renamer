# Task runner for tv_renamer. See the project-standards skill for the verb
# contract: lint is read-only and total, format is its mutating twin, and
# check is the full gate that CI runs.

# Default: list available recipes
default:
    @just --list

# Install dependencies
sync:
    uv sync --dev

# All read-only static checks
lint:
    uv run ruff check .
    uv run ruff format --check .

# Apply formatting and safe lint fixes
format:
    uv run ruff format .
    uv run ruff check --fix .

# Type check
# New repos: include tests/. Migrating an existing repo: start with the
# package alone — widening to tests usually surfaces real errors that
# belong in their own change.
# Scoped to the package; widening to tests/ deferred (mypy 2.3 override regression).
type-check:
    uv run mypy src/tv_renamer/

# Run tests
test *args:
    uv run pytest -vv {{ args }}

# Everything CI runs
check: lint type-check test

# Build the package
build:
    uv build

# Remove build and cache artifacts
clean:
    rm -rf dist/ build/ *.egg-info .pytest_cache .ruff_cache .mypy_cache

# Install the pre-commit hook into this clone
hooks-install:
    @mkdir -p .git/hooks
    @cp bin/pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
    @chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
    @echo "Pre-commit hook installed."
